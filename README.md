## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I was able to practice and learn how to use CSS Flexbox to align itens and container in the internet page.



```css
  .card-content{
    display: flex;
    min-height: 100vh;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);

}

```
I also practiced how to make a responsive page using media query

```css
@media (max-width: 375px){
    .qrcode-container{
        flex-basis: 250px;
        height: 400px;
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;

    }

```


### Continued development

In future projects I intend to continue practicing HTML, CSS and I want to add JavaScript.
